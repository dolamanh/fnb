// User Module - Example module structure for future features
// This shows how to organize code by features/modules when needed

// For now, just re-export main entities for reference
export type { User } from '../../core/entities/User';
export { UserListScreen } from '../../presentation/screens/UserListScreen';

// Note: This file is not currently used in the app
// It's here as a placeholder for future modularization
